Matrix 7:
[   2   1  -4 ]
[  -8  -4  16 ]
[   2   1  -4 ]


Steps to find inverse using Gauss-Jordan elimination:
Initial augmented matrix:
[   2   1  -4 |   1   0   0 ]
[  -8  -4  16 |   0   1   0 ]
[   2   1  -4 |   0   0   1 ]


Step 1: Divide row 1 by 2
[   1 1/2       -2 | 1/2        0   0 ]
[  -8  -4  16 |   0   1   0 ]
[   2   1  -4 |   0   0   1 ]


Step 2: Subtract -8 times row 1 from row 2
[   1 1/2       -2 | 1/2        0   0 ]
[   0   0   0 |   4   1   0 ]
[   2   1  -4 |   0   0   1 ]


Step 3: Subtract 2 times row 1 from row 3
[   1 1/2       -2 | 1/2        0   0 ]
[   0   0   0 |   4   1   0 ]
[   0   0   0 |  -1   0   1 ]
